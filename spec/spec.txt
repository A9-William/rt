[Remaining TODOs]

Finish Txn display for User and Group
    UI done, needs to referentialise OldReference etc.
ACL for per-CF editing
    UI done, needs to verify API

===================================================================================
    AdminThis ACL for CFs controls CF data and metadata, but _not_ where it applies
    AdminCF ACL for Objects controls what CFs applies here, but _not_ CF's contents
===================================================================================

> As part of this work, Best Practical will provide a metadata system for
> User and Groups akin to RT's current "CustomFields" system for tickets.
> Best Practical will add new search functionality to allow CUSTOMER customer
> support staff to search for users based on site-configurable metadata
> about users and their organizations.
> RT will be extended to track custom field changes on each type of object
> that supports custom fields.
> Best Practical will develop new user interface to display the history of
> each User and Group object, including all changes to custom fields.
> User Display
> RT's User display will be enhanced to include display and editing of
> custom fields, as well as display of group memberships.
> Group Display
> RT's Group display will be enhanced to include display and editing of
> custom fields.

The above goes together.  Highly interested.  2-3 weeks of work.  12k.

> User and Group searching
> The results of user and group searches will be downloadable as tab
> delimited data, containing a list of columns to be specified at a later
> time.

I think you have done this already?  2 days of work, 1k.

> Custom Field Functionality
> Best Practical will extend RT's custom fields system to support
> per-field access control.. Staff will be able to grant members of groups
> as well as individual end-users the right to:
> * See a custom field
> * Edit a custom field's values for the object it applies to
> * Manage a custom field
>   Each Custom field that applies to users will be available for all
> users
>  Each Custom fields that applies to groups will be available for all
> groups

Quite interested. 2 weeks of work. 10k.

> Custom fields will be extended to support several new data types:
>         large freeform text
>         uploaded documents, including images

Trivial. 2 days of work, 1k.

> Ticket Searching
> RT's standard search functionality will be extended to support the
> ability to find tickets that have a requestor who is a member of a
> user-specified group.

Trivial. 1 day of work, $500 or so.

> Ticket Display
> When viewing a ticket, RT currently displays a box containing metadata
> about each requestor who is not a local staff member. Best Practical
> will extend this box to list the requestor's group memberships.

Not very interested. 2 days of work, 1k.
