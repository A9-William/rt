Upgrade instructions (From any 2.2.x release)
-----------------------------------------------------

There were no database changes from 2.2 to 2.4
you should be able to follow the normal
installation instructions which will overwrite
existing RTFM code with the 2.4 version.

It is recommended that you make a backup of your
/opt/rt3 directory in case there are problems

After installing 2.4, stop and start your web
server, clearing your mason cache if necesary.

Upgrade instructions (From any  2.0.x release):
-----------------------------------------------------

1) perl Makefile.PL

2) perl -I/path/to/your/rt/lib sbin/migrate-2.0-to-2.1

3) Type "make install"

4) Type "ls etc/upgrade"; For each item in that directory whose name
   is greater than your previously installed RTFM version, run:

            /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --action schema \
                --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>
            /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --action acl \
                --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>
            /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --action insert \
                 --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>
