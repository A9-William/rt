From RT3.0.x:

    Read this document for important instructions on updating your
database.  The README file contains the process for upgrading.

    The short version:

    - Run the configure program exactly as you did previously.

      (Look at the config.log file from the previous source tree to
      figure out what that was.)

    - make upgrade

    - stop and start your apache

From RT2.0.x:

    
    Download the RT2 to RT3 migration tools from:

    http://bestpractical.com/pub/rt/devel/rt2-to-rt3.tar.gz

    Follow the included instructions.

WARNING

Before making any changes to your database, always ensure that you have a 
complete current backup. If you don't have a current backup, you could 
accidentally damage your database and lose data or worse.


UPGRADING FROM 3.0.x - Changes:

Now, if you want RT to automatically create new users upon ticket
submission, you MUST grant 'Everyone' the right to create tickets.
Granting this right only to "Unprivileged Users" is now insufficient.
