UPGRADING

If you are upgrading from versions between 3.0.0 and 3.0.6, inclusive,
you might find improved performance by adding the following indices to
your database:

   CREATE INDEX TicketCustomFieldValues1 ON TicketCustomFieldValues (CustomField,Ticket,Content); 
   CREATE INDEX TicketCustomFieldValues2 ON TicketCustomFieldValues (CustomField,Ticket); 

   CREATE INDEX CustomFieldValues1 ON CustomFieldValues (CustomField);

If you have a Postgres database, the following changes to your
database can improve performance:

  ALTER TABLE groups rename instance to instance1;
  ALTER TABLE groups add instance int;
  UPDATE  groups SET instance = instance::text::int where btrim(instance) <> ''
  ALTER TABLE groups drop column instance1;
