accidentally damage your database and lose data or worse.

Detailed information about upgrading can be found in the README file.

UPGRADING FROM 3.0.x - Changes:

Now, if you want RT to automatically create new users upon ticket

Granting this right only to "Unprivileged Users" is now insufficient.
