Before making any changes to your database, always ensure that you have a 
complete current backup. If you don't have a current backup, you could 
accidentally damage your database and lose data or worse.

If you are using MySQL, please read the instructions in UPGRADING.mysql as
well to ensure that you do not lose data in your upgrade.

We have moved large upgrade changes and steps into
docs/UPGRADING-version files which you should refer to for specific
instructions.  If you are coming from 3.8.6 to 4.0.x you should review
both the 3.8 and 4.0 file.  Similarly, if you were coming from 3.6.7,
you would want to review 3.6, 3.8 and 4.0

It is particularly important that you read the warnings at the top of
UPGRADING-4.0 for some common issues.
