Upgrade instructions (From any 2.2.x release)
-----------------------------------------------------

There were no database changes from 2.2 to 2.4
you should be able to follow the normal
installation instructions which will overwrite
existing RTFM code with the 2.4 version.

Do not run the make initdb command

It is recommended that you make a backup of your
/opt/rt3 directory in case there are problems

After installing 2.4, stop and start your web
server, clearing your mason cache if necesary.

If you installed an earlier version of RTFM on
mysql 4.0 and are now upgrading to 4.1 or higher,
you need to upgrade the database tables types.
This is similar to the process for RT.
See UPGRADING.mysql

Upgrade Instructions from 2.1.x
-----------------------------------------------------

1) perl Makefile.PL

2) make install

4) Type "ls etc/upgrade"; For each item in that directory whose name
   is greater than your previously installed RTFM version, run:

            /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --action schema \
                --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>
            /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --action acl \
                --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>
            /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --action insert \
                 --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>

   For the 2.2.0RC2 updates and 2.1.30 updates you may need to
   run these as a superuser because they issue ALTER TABLE statements.

   You can do this by adding the --dba root --prompt-for-dba-password
   flags, like so:

            /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --action schema \
                --dba root --prompt-for-dba-password \
                --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>
            /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --action acl \
                --dba root --prompt-for-dba-password \
                --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>
            /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --action insert \
                --dba root --prompt-for-dba-password \
                 --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>

5) If you are running 3.8, you need to enable RTFM in your 
   RT_SiteConfig.pm file.  You can do this by adding the following
   line:

   Set(@Plugins,qw(RT::FM));

6) clear your mason cache.  This is most often accomplished with
   rm -rf /opt/rt3/var/mason_data/*

7) stop and start your web server


Upgrade instructions (From any  2.0.x release):
-----------------------------------------------------

1) perl Makefile.PL

2) perl -I/path/to/your/rt/lib sbin/migrate-2.0-to-2.1

if you are installing 2.4.x on a new machine and have brought
your old 2.0.x database over, you will need a copy of the
RTFM 2.0 libs.  You can bring these from your old machine or
download them from http://download.bestpractical.com
This command would then be

perl -I/path/to/your/old/rtfm/lib -I/path/to/rt/lib sbin/migrate-2.0-to-2.1

3) Type "make install"

4) Type "ls etc/upgrade"; For each item in that directory whose name
   is greater than your previously installed RTFM version, run:

            /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --action schema \
                --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>
            /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --action acl \
                --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>
            /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --action insert \
                 --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>

5) See note in ugprading from 2.2.x about UPGRADING.mysql

6) stop and start your web server
