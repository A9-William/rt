UPGRADING

WARNING
*******


Before making any changes to your database, always ensure that you have a 
complete current backup. If you don't have a current backup, you could 
accidentally damage your database and lose data or worse.


UPGRADING FROM 3.0.x - Changes:

Now, if you want RT to automatically create new users upon ticket
submission, you MUST grant 'Everyone' the right to create tickets.
Granting this right only to "Unprivileged Users" is now insufficient.
