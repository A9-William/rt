=head2 Basics

Staff users should be now have a new "RTFM" menu item RT's top level menu.
As an administrator, you should go create some "Classes" of articles in RTFM.
Classes are equivalent to RT's queues. Unlike RTFM 1.0, RTFM 2.0 doesn't have a
single "body" section for each article. Everything is a custom field (except
for name, summary and some other basic metadata). So, you need to go create
some custom fields.

Once you've created your custom fields, go into your classes and click
on "Custom Fields" and add the Custom Fields you want to each class.

Grant some ACLs to your users and start creating articles.

You can also bind articles to topics. Topics are created by administrators
on classes using the 'Topics' submenu of the RTFM class configuration.
The configuration screen for the class has a tab for 'topics'. Typing the
name (and optionally description) of the topic, and then clicking the button
at the appropriate location. This should allow you to build a tree of topics.
This tree of topics should show up when creating or modifying articles
in the class. These can be arbitrarily nested categories.

Articles topics can be set from the 'Modify' screen for the article --
simply select as many topics as you desire from the list at the bottom
of the screen.

Of course, RTFM integrates with RT.  You can extract the body of a
ticket into an article. Within RT, you should now see an "Extract to
article" button in the upper right hand corner of RT's UI when working
with tickets. When you click that button, RTFM will ask you which
Class to create your new article in.  Once you click on a class name,
the Ticket's transactions will be displayed, along with a set of
select boxes. For each transaction, you can pick which Freeform, Text,
or WikiText field that transaction should be extracted to. From there
on in, it's just regular article creation.  And the integration
doesn't stop there! When replying to or commenting on tickets, there's
a new UI widget that lets you search for and include RTFM articles in
your reply. (They're editable, of course).
