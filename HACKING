Many of the modules have proper POD documentation. Those that don't
need to be documented. nag an RT developer

OUTLINE

There are still some elements from the code of the old 1.0, but most
of the code is fresh.  The new object oriented code is mainly placed
in the lib/RT/ directory, while the old code mainly remains in lib/rt
(in addition to bin/rtmux.pl and some more).


DEBUGGING HINTS

If you have anything you think might fit under a DEBUGGING HINTS
section, it be either general about debugging perl code and/or cgis or
RT-specific hints, don't hesitate mailing me.  I think debugging is an
underestimated science.  Debugging tend to eat up a quite large part
of the total development time, the more complex the project the larger
part.  Any knowledge that can reduce the debugging time and increase
the code stability (and efficiency, for that sake) should be shared.

I found it a lot more enjoyable to mess around with RT after I started
using the perl debug functionallity extensively.  I even use it
actively during development; having a perl debug session in one window
allows me to quickly test out how methods work, etc, which can be
quite much more efficient than looking up the docs, specifications
and/or code.

Setting up RT for debugging and development
===========================================

Because rtmux.pl is a suid script (it must be for one and only thing;
reading the DB password from a protected file - I just thought of it,
maybe it's better to separate out those two lines of code and fetch it
through a backticked command or something) perl -d (at least under
perl 5.004_05, haven't checked with more recent versions yet) break
even when run as root.

Also, I don't want to mess around directly with the production
library, so I've copied rtmux.pl into rtmux-experimental.pl, changed
it a bit (i.e. letting it use my RT working directory as the lib dir)
and removed the suid-bit.  Then I created a new subdirectory,
experimental, and linked over rtmux-experimental.pl:

	mkdir experimental
	cd experimental
	ln -s ../rtmux-experimental.pl rt
	ln -s ../rtmux-experimental.pl rtadmin
	ln -s ../rtmux-experimental.pl rt-mailgate
	ln -s ../rtmux-experimental.pl webrt.cgi
	ln -s ../rtmux-experimental.pl admin-webrt.cgi

...and then perl -d ./rt simply worked.


Using the perl debugger with RT
===============================

I think the cli should accept all parameters as command line options.
Anyway, I don't have time fixing it, so to feed the cli with
parameters quite ugly constructs like this one has to be used:

	echo -e "general\n\ntobiasb\ntobiasb\n\n\ndfg\n\n\n\nsafsadf\n.\n" |
		/usr/bin/perl -dwT ./rt -create

Something of the same can be used for the cgi.

While developing a certain module, I included it in the options to Perl:

	echo -e "general\n\ntobiasb\ntobiasb\n\n\ndfg\n\n\n\nsafsadf\n.\n" |
		/usr/bin/perl -I /my/working/dir/lib/ -MRT::Module -dwT \
	        ./rt -create

I like to keep as much as possible on one-liners in the bash shell as
it makes it easy to repeat the command with a ctrl-r or ctrl-p action.
(I guess more hard-core perl hackers uses perl -de1 as their primary
shell anyway :)

After entering the line above, it should be possible to write
something like:

c RT::Module::SubImWorkingAt

(if Tab Completion doesn't work, you'd better install Term::ReadLine
ASAP :)

SQL and database debugging
==========================

Probably you don't have to care much about the Database Access.  It's
abstracted into DBIx::EasySearch and DBIx::Record, which just seems to
work - at least with mysql.

Currently RT writes out very much verbose debug information, including
the SQL calls.  mysql has the possibility of writing very verbose logs
- I love those logs - personally I think it's better looking into
those logs than letting the script print out the SQL.
