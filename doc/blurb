RT is designed to help a group of people manage both external and internal requests.  It's based on the req tool by Remy Evard of the CCS group at Northeastern University.  RT differs from req in several important respects:  
     * designed around an SQL database (mSQL)
     * employs a sophisticated access control mechanism
     * supports multiple queues with different permissions schemes
     * allows dynamic reconfiguration of almost all parameters
       (the rest are things you just wouldn't want to change)
     * written in modular perl 5 
       (excluding 2 small C programs for uniqueid generation and safe SUID 
 	capability) 
     * Robust web interface in addition to standard CLI
     * Significantly less mature codebase than req
