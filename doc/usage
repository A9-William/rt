The RT model is both simpler and more complex than the req model.

	Bob has just signed on as a new sysadmin at Whatsamatta U. and sits down in front of his snazzy new SGI Ultraviolet workstation for his first day on the job.  He's both surprised and relieved when he's informed that he doesn't have to run some beast like Lotus Bloats to keep track of the "emergencies" that he has to deal with.  First thing in the morning, his boss Larry calls him over to his VT and explains about the basics of RT:
	
	"RT's a set of perl scripts that keeps track of chatter within the systems group and with users.  The first thing we've gotta do is set you up with access to the database.

	rtadmin user -create bob
