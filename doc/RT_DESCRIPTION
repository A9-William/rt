	You've probably got a todo list. If you don't, you probably keep
meaning to write one out.  But the second you've got a list it's outdated. 
You're not alone. In fact, if you poke around your department, you're
likely to find that almost everybody's got a personal white board with a
todo list, or scraps of paper or a list on their Newton/Pilot.  Most of
these systems probably work. But they could be better.  In this age of
groupware, your todo list needs to have full email connectivity. It needs
a web interface.  It needs to have a database backend to permit quick
searching.  It needs to be able to handle your personal todo list and your
department's group todo list.  It needs to keep track of who's doing what.
It needs to keep track of what's already been done.  In short, it needs a
full bit-trail. (Keeping track of sheets of dead trees is a bit outside of
the scope of this project.  Maybe in version 2.0 ;)  

	Well, your wait is over.  RT (Request Tracker) is here.  RT is a
set of perl scripts backed by an mSQL database. (Other databases are
possible) 

	What your users need to know about RT:

	We've got a new request tracking system called RT.  Anytime you
send mail to systems@somewhere.com, you'll get a request ticket back
(assuming that there isn't already a request ticket in the mail you sent). 
It will look something like this:

------------------------------------ Requests managaged by Request Tracker



	Hang onto this message until you're satisfied that your request
has been resolved.  To send any sort of followup message to the systems
group, just reply to the ticket.  If you no longer have the ticket in your
mailbox, just send a message to systems@somewhere.com making sure that
you've put the request ID in the subject line (ex [Somewhere #45].)  You
<b>do not</b> need to send a carbon copy of any systems related mail to
any individual.  RT automatically figures out which people should get your
request and routes it to them.  By using the RT system, we're able to
maintain a complete audit trail for all requests and to provide you with
better service.  If you end up making a request of a member of the systems
group verbally, please follow it up with a message to
systems@somewhere.com--It helps us to allocate resources properly.
