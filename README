REQUIRED PACKAGES:
------------------

o   Perl5.x ( http://www.perl.com ) -- free

o   MySQL ( http://www.tcx.se ) -- free

        FTP mysql from www.tcx.se and follow the INSTALL instructions
        contained therein

o   MysqlPerl ( http://www.tcx.se ) -- free

        FTP mysqlperl from www.tcx.se and follow the INSTALL instructions
        containted therein

o   Glimpse 4.0 (http://glimpse.cs.arizona.edu) -- free (detect a trend?)

        FTP glimpse from ftp.cs.arizona.edu and follow the install
	instructions containted therein.

        At this stage of the game, glimpse won't buy you any
	functionality.  However, in the future, it will make your life
	much easier by allowing you to search the full text of requests easily.


INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------

 

With all of the above installed, it's time to do the rather easy job
of installing RT.  Choose a directory in which you wish to install RT. 
For the sake of simplicity, we use /usr/local/rt as the installation
directory.

If you wish to install this software in an alternate location, please
refer to the section entitled ALTERNATE INSTALLATION.


GENERAL INSTALLATION
--------------------

 

1   Unpack this distribution as /usr/local/rt

        Granted, you've already got it open. To do this cleanly:

        	tar xzvf rt.tar.gz -C /usr/local

2   Create a user rt with primary group rt

3   Check over /usr/local/rt/src/Makefile

        Mainly, you want to make sure all the paths up top are correct.
        Specifically, you NEED to change the value for $rtpass to something
        secret.  After all, you don't want other people logging in and mucking
        with your request database.  Though it is nice to be able to escalate
        one's requests secretly ;)

4a  FOR A NEW INSTALLATION: (If you don't have RT requests you want to keep):

        As ROOT: make install

4b  FOR UPGRADING: (After RT version 970802):

        As ROOT: make upgrade
	NOTE: UPGRADE DOES NOT YET EXIST
	This will compile new RT wrappers and libraries without
	overwriting your RT database.
 

SETTING UP THE ALIAS
--------------------

In general, that is about it.  All of the proper files have been
configured at this point, and you are nearly ready to get the entire
system up and running.

An alias for the initial queue will need to be made in either your
global mail aliases file (if you are using NIS) or locally on your
machine.

 
Add the following line to /etc/aliases (or your local equivalent) :

        rt:     |"/usr/local/rt/bin/rt-mailgate general correspond"
                                                    |          |
                                   <<queue-name>----/          |
                                                               |
                <<correspond or comment depending on whether   |
                 the mail shoud be resent to the requestor>---/
		 "action" here will make this address only
		  parse actions in the message without 
		  recording the message as a transaction
		  of its own"


THE WEB UI
----------

If you don't already have an http daemon set up, you will probably want
to start one to handle the CGI interface.  For now, I'd recommend the CERN
httpd.  Apache with www.hughes.com's authentication patches has been
reported to work, as well.  See the following URL for apache patches:
 	http://www.Hughes.com.au/software/misc/apache_1.2.1_hughes.tar.gz 
Netscape's servers don't allow nph-cgi scripts to perform their own 
authentication so they don't really work well with WebRT.

The CERN httpd ( http://www.w3.org ) is free.  A sample config file
is in rt/etc/httpd/cern.   Invoke it with the following command line:

         /path/to/cern/httpd -r /usr/local/rt/etc/httpd/cern/httpd.conf

o     you'll find rt-admin at http://host:8080/rt/nph-admin-webrt.cgi
o     you'll find rt at http://host:8080/rt/nph-webrt.cgi and
o                       http://host:8080/rt/nph-webrt.cgi/frames

 

THE CLI
-------


        Binaries for the CLI are located in /usr/local/rt/bin
        You've got:

                "rtq" (display a request queue)
                "rt" (manipulate a request)
                "rtadmin" (modify queues, users and acls)

        All three of these programs take --help as an option.

NOTE: The only user with acls to access rt is root.
NOTE: root's password for the web interface is "wordpass" (without the quotes)

 
THE MAIL GATEWAY
----------------

	The RT Mail Gateway can now be used to perform actions on requests. 
	For an explanation of how to use the Mail Gateway, send a message to
	any RT address with the command %RT HELP on a line by itself.


ALTERNATE INSTALLATION
----------------------

So you are being daring and attempting to either install RT into a
place other than /usr/local or you would prefer to use an account/group
other than "rt". That shouldn't pose a problem, really.  The regular
installation is rather easy and this only adds a few steps.

 
1   Unpack this distribution as <<path>/rt

        Granted, you've already got it open. To do this cleanly:

                tar xzvf rt.tar.gz -C <<path>

2   Create a user <<username> with primary group <<groupname>

    Edit the following files to reflect the username and groupname changes:

    o   <<path_to_rt>/lib/routines/RT.pm
    o   <<path_to_rt>/etc/mysql.acl
    o   <<path_to_rt>/src/Makefile

3   Edit the following files, changing the path to the RT directory:


    o <<path_to_rt>/lib/interfaces/cli_admin.pl
    o <<path_to_rt>/lib/interfaces/cli_manipulate.pl
    o <<path_to_rt>/lib/interfaces/cli_queue.pl
    o <<path_to_rt>/lib/interfaces/mail_gateway.pl
    o <<path_to_rt>/lib/interfaces/web_admin.pl
    o <<path_to_rt>/lib/interfaces/web_manipulate.pl

    o <<path_to_rt>/lib/routines/RT.pm


4   Follow the instructions above, starting from step 3

 
 
RT-USERS MAILINGLIST
--------------------


By now, you've probably hit at least one sticking point. you probably
want to join the RT-users mailinglist.  Send a message to:

         rt-users-request@auk.con.wesleyan.edu

With the body of the message consisting of only the word:

        subscribe

Address questions to the mailinglist.  If you feel your questions are
best not asked publically, send them to me personally at:
jrvincent@wesleyan.edu.




CREDITS
-------

A lot of people are responsible for making RT a better program.  Many
thanks to Lauren Burka, who originally tasked me with writing this beast.
She forced me to use a database backend.  I've thanked her for it every
day since.  Rich West rewrote this readme and did some UI hacking.  Adam
Hirsch, John Adams, Trey Belew, Sean Dague, Nathan Mehl and Kee Hinckley
have all contributed bug reports or ideas that have helped RT along.  If
I've left you out, please drop me a line....it wasn't intentional. 
 
        Enjoy
