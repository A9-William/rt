RT/FAQ Manager is a tool for maintaining an organizational knowledgebase, including articles tagged with structured, site-defined metadata.

RT/FM allows anyone to browse, search and read articles.

Users who are marked as 'Editors' can create and edit articles.

Users who are marked as 'Administrators' can modify what metadata is
tracked about articles and can create, delete and modify users.


1) Install some prerequisites:

It needs HTML::Mason, apache, Apache::Session, mod_perl, DBI, DBIx::SearchBuilder, Log::Dispatch, MIME::Entity and likely some other stuff I'm forgetting at the moment.


2) Edit the makefile and 'make install',

RT/FM will install its binaries, libraries and configuration file.


3) Edit RT/FM's newly installed configuration file (etc/rtfm_config.pm),
setting things like the mason data directory and the apache::session 
session directory. 

4) Configure apache to start RT/FM:

PerlRequire /opt/rtfm/bin/webmux.pl
Alias /fm /opt/rtfm/html

<Location /fm>
 SetHandler perl-script
 PerlHandler RT::FM::Mason
</Location>


5) go check out RT/FM.  (When you want to get into the administrative functions,
root's password is 'password')
