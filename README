SEVERAL SITES FOR OVER A YEAR, HOWEVER I MAKE NO PROMISES AS TO ITS
STABILITY.

Development of RT has been sponsored in part by Utopia Inc, by The
Leftbank Operation and by Wesleyan University.

Some code for RT has been derived from Remy Evard's req package.

        contained therein

	CGI-Cookie is required for web authentication to work.

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------

With all of the above installed, it's time to do the rather easy job
of installing RT.  Choose a directory in which you wish to install RT. 
For the sake of simplicity, we use /usr/local/rt in our example.


GENERAL INSTALLATION
--------------------

0   If you are upgrading from .9.1 or earlier, Read README.91UPGRADE before 
    you touch ANYTHING

1   Unpack this distribution SOMWHERE OTHER THAN where you want to install RT

        Granted, you've already got it open. To do this cleanly:

        	tar xzvf rt.tar.gz -C /tmp

2   Create a user rt with primary group rt

3   Check over /tmp/rt/Makefile

	There are many variables you NEED to customize for your site.
	Even if you are just upgrading, you must set ALL variables.

4a  FOR A NEW INSTALLATION: (If you don't have RT requests you want to keep)

        As ROOT: make install

4b  FOR UPGRADING: (From any RT installation NEWER than RT 0.9.2)

        As ROOT: make upgrade
	This will build new RT wrappers, config files and libraries without
	overwriting your RT database.

5   Configure the email and web gateways, as described below. 

6   Using rtadmin, add a RT user for yourself.  Add an RT queue.   
    This must be done as root, as the only user with acls to access rt is root.

            [root@host bin]# ./rtadmin queue -create general
            [root@host bin]# ./rtadmin user  -create joebob

    NOTE: root's password for the web interface is "wordpass" 
    (without the quotes.)  Not changing this is a SECURITY risk  
 
7   Edit templates to your liking. Templates are found in
    rt/etc/templates/queues/<queue-name>



SETTING UP THE MAIL GATEWAY 
---------------------------

An alias for the initial queue will need to be made in either your
global mail aliases file (if you are using NIS) or locally on your
machine.
 
Add the following line to /etc/aliases (or your local equivalent) :

        rt:     |"/path/to/lrt/bin/rt-mailgate general correspond"
                                                    |          |
                                   <<queue-name>----/          |
                                                               |
                <<correspond or comment depending on whether   |
                 the mail shoud be resent to the requestor>---/
		 "action" here will make this address only
		  parse actions in the message without 
		  recording the message as a transaction
		  of its own"

The RT Mail Gateway can be used to perform actions on requests.
For an explanation of how to use the Mail Gateway, send a message to
any RT alias with the command %RT HELP on a line by itself.     

You'll need an alias like the following for action requests:

        rt-action:      |"/path/to/rt/bin/rt-mailgate general action"
	

THE WEB UI
----------

If you don't already have an http daemon set up, you will probably want
to start one to handle the CGI interface.  For now, I'd recommend the Apache
httpd.  Additionally, you'll need a web browser that supports cookies.

CERN:
	It just works. We even include a sample config file for you

	A sample config is in rt/etc/httpd/cern. Invoke it with the 
	following command line:

         /path/to/cern/httpd -r /path/to/rt/etc/httpd/cern/httpd.conf

	o     you'll find rt-admin at http://host:8080/rt/nph-admin-webrt.cgi
	o     you'll find rt at http://host:8080/rt/nph-webrt.cgi and
	o                       http://host:8080/rt/nph-webrt.cgi/frames


Apache 
	To get Apache working, you'll want to add two lines to your httpd.conf:

	Alias /webrt/ "/path/to/rt/lib/images/"
	ScriptAlias /rt/ "/path/to/rt/bin/cgi/"

        o     you'll find rt-admin at http://host/rt/nph-admin-webrt.cgi
        o     you'll find rt at http://host/rt/nph-webrt.cgi and
        o                       http://host/rt/nph-webrt.cgi/frames


Netscape:
	You're on your own for configuring it, but it should work just fine.


THE CLI
-------

        Binaries for the CLI are located in /usr/local/rt/bin
        You've got:

                "rtq" (display a request queue)
                "rt" (manipulate a request)
                "rtadmin" (modify queues, users and acls)

        All three of these programs take --help as an option.


RT-USERS MAILINGLIST
--------------------


By now, you've probably hit at least one sticking point. you probably
want to join the RT-users mailinglist.  Send a message to:

         rt-users-request@lists.fsck.com 

With the body of the message consisting of only the word:

        subscribe

Address questions to the mailinglist.  If you feel your questions are
best not asked publically, send them to me personally at:
jrvincent@wesleyan.edu.

If you're interested in hacking on rt, you;ll want to subscribe to 
rt-devel@fsck.com.  Subscribe to it with instructions similar to those 
above.



CREDITS
-------

A lot of people are responsible for making RT a better program.  Many
thanks to Lauren Burka, who originally tasked me with writing this beast.
She forced me to use a database backend.  I've thanked her for it every

Sean Dague, Nathan Mehl, Kee Hinckley, Rich West, Dale Bewley, Serge Zhuk,
Gerald Abshez, Dave Hull, Dave Schenet and Dave Walton have all contributed

please drop me a line....it wasn't intentional. 
 
        Enjoy
