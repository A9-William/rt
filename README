RTFM (The RT FAQ Manager) is a tool for maintaining an organizational
knowledgebase. Out of the box, it integrates with RT 3.4.2 or later
(Also available from bestpractical.com)

Best Practical sells support and customization for RT and RTFM.  Feel
free to contact us at sales@bestpractical.com if you have any
questions about our service offerings.

RTFM requires a few modules in addition to RT's standard dependencies.
The 'perl Makefile.PL' command will check that you have all of the
required modules installed; if not, they will either be auto-installed
during the 'make' step, or you can opt to install them by hand using
the CPAN shell or with any system-specific package management software
you may have.

Installation instructions:
--------------------------

1) Install RT 3.4.2 or newer

2) Once RT appears to be happily installed, cd into the directory you
   unpacked RTFM into.

3) perl Makefile.PL

4) make install

5) make initdb

6) stop and start your web server


Upgrade instructions (From any  2.0.x release):
-----------------------------------------------------

1) perl Makefile.PL

2) perl -I/path/to/your/rt/lib sbin/migrate-2.0-to-2.1

3) Type "make install"

4) Type "ls etc/upgrade"; For each item in that directory whose name
   is greater than your previously installed RTFM version, run:

            /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --action schema \
                --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>
            /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --action acl \
                --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>
            /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --action insert \
                 --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>

5) stop and start your web server



Staff users should be now have a new "RTFM" menu item RT's top level menu.
As an administrator, you should go create some "Classes" of articles in RTFM.
Classes are equivalent to RT's queues. Unlike RTFM 1.0, RTFM 2.0 doesn't have a
single "body" section for each article. Everything is a custom field (except
for name, summary and some other basic metadata). So, you need to go create
some custom fields.

Once you've created your custom fields, go into your classes and click
on "Custom Fields" and add the Custom Fields you want to each class.

Grant some ACLs to your users and start creating articles.

You can also bind articles to topics. Topics are created by administrators
on classes using the 'Topics' submenu of the RTFM class configuration.
The configuration screen for the class has a tab for 'topics'. Typing the
name (and optionally description) of the topic, and then clicking the button
at the appropriate location. This should allow you to build a tree of topics.
This tree of topics should show up when creating or modifying articles
in the class. These can be arbitrarily nested categories.

Articles topics can be set from the 'Modify' screen for the article --
simply select as many topics as you desire from the list at the bottom
of the screen.

Of course, RTFM integrates with RT.  You can extract the body of a
ticket into an article. Within RT, you should now see an "Extract to
article" button in the upper right hand corner of RT's UI when working
with tickets. When you click that button, RTFM will ask you which
Class to create your new article in.  Once you click on a class name,
the Ticket's transactions will be displayed, along with a set of
select boxes. For each transaction, you can pick which Freeform, Text,
or WikiText field that transaction should be extracted to. From there
on in, it's just regular article creation.  And the integration
doesn't stop there! When replying to or commenting on tickets, there's
a new UI widget that lets you search for and include RTFM articles in
your reply. (They're editable, of course).
