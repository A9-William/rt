STATUS 
------

This is a development release in the cycle toward RT2. This is NOT 
a stable release.  Lots of things are still missing.  Don't expect it 
to just work out of the box.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

With all of the above installed, it's time to do the rather easy job
of installing RT.  Choose a directory in which you wish to install RT. 
For the sake of simplicity, we use /usr/local/rt in our example.


GENERAL INSTALLATION
--------------------

1   Unpack this distribution SOMWHERE OTHER THAN where you want to install RT

        Granted, you've already got it open. To do this cleanly:

        	tar xzvf rt.tar.gz -C /tmp

2   Satisfy RT's myriad dependencies.  There's a perl script in rt/bin
    called testdeps.pl that uses CPAN to automate all of this.

2.1   Check for compliance:
	perl rt/bin/testdeps.pl -warn

2.2   If there are unsatisfied dependencies, install them by hand or
      run rt/bin/testdeps.pl -fix

3   Create a user rt with primary group rt

4   Check over /tmp/rt/Makefile

	There are many variables you NEED to customize for your site.
	Even if you are just upgrading, you must set ALL variables.

5a  FOR A NEW INSTALLATION: 
        
        As root, type:
		 make install	(replace "make" with the local name for 
				 Make, if you need to)


5b  FOR UPGRADING: (Within the RT 2.0.x series)
        As root, type: 
		make upgrade     (replace "make" with the local name for 
				  Make, if you need to)

	This will build new RT wrappers, config files and libraries without
	overwriting your RT database.
	WARNING: Note that this will clobber your configuration file!
	
5c  FOR UPGRADING (From 1.0.x):

        Not supported yet 

6   Configure the email and web gateways, as described below. 

7   Edit etc/config.pm in your RT installation directory.  In many
    cases sensible defaults have been included. In others, you MUST
    supply a value.

8   The admin tools doesn't work yet, so this information is slightly
    inaccurate:

    Using rtadmin, or admin-webrt.cgi add a RT user for yourself.  Add an RT 
    queue. This must be done as root, as the only user with acls to access rt 
    is root.
	
	Commandline instructions:

            [root@host bin]# ./rtadmin queue -create <queue name>
            [root@host bin]# ./rtadmin user  -create <user name>

	Web instructions:
	
	    Click on "Create a user called" (after filling out the text input 
					     to the right of the button)
	
	    Click on "Create a queue called"  (after filling out the text input 
                                             to the right of the button)


    NOTE: root's password for the web interface is "wordpass" 
    (without the quotes.)  Not changing this is a SECURITY risk
    


SETTING UP THE MAIL GATEWAY 
---------------------------

An alias for the initial queue will need to be made in either your
global mail aliases file (if you are using NIS) or locally on your
machine.
 
Add the following lines to /etc/aliases (or your local equivalent) :

TODO: THE CALLING CONVENTION FOR THE MAILGATE HAS CHANGED

    rt-comment: |"/path/to/rt/bin/rt-mailgate --queue general --action comment"
    rt:         |"/path/to/rt/bin/rt-mailgate --queue general --action correspond"
                                                    |          |
                                   <<queue-name>----/          |
                                                               |
                <<correspond or comment depending on whether   |
                 the mail shoud be resent to the requestor>---/
		 "action" here will make this address only
		  parse actions in the message without 
		  recording the message as a transaction
		  of its own"

The RT Mail Gateway can be used to perform actions on requests.
For an explanation of how to use the Mail Gateway, send a message to
any RT alias with the command %RT HELP on a line by itself.     

You'll need an alias like the following for action requests:

        rt-action:      |"/path/to/rt/bin/rt-mailgate --queue general --action action"
	

THE WEB UI
----------
If you don't already have an http daemon set up, you will probably want
to start one to handle the CGI interface.  For now, I'd recommend the Apache
httpd.  Additionally, you'll need a web browser that supports unless you've 
enabled "external" authentication above.

Apache 
        RT Uses HTML::Mason.  You'll need to add a few lines to your
        httpd.conf telling it to use rt's web ui.  If you have mod-perl
	(you should, the perl scripts will go quite a bit faster around with
	it), you can do something like this:


<VirtualHost your.ip.address>
DocumentRoot /opt/rt/WebRT/html
ServerName your.rt.server.hostname
PerlRequire /opt/rt/bin/webmux.pl
<Location />
 SetHandler perl-script
 PerlHandler RT::Mason
</Location>
</VirtualHost>


THE CLI
-------
        Binaries for the CLI are located in /usr/local/rt/bin
        You've got:

                "rtq" (display a request queue)
                "rt" (manipulate a request)
                "rtadmin" (modify queues, users and acls)

        All three of these programs take --help as an option.
	

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

All errors will be appended to a logfile, which lives in /tmp/rt.log unless 
you've reconfigured it.  Check etc/config.pm for details.

If the solution to the problem you're running into isn't obvious and you've 
checked the FAQ, feel free to send mail to rt-users@fsck.com (for release 
versions of RT) or rt-devel@fsck.com (for development versions).

RT-USERS MAILINGLIST
--------------------

By now, you've probably hit at least one sticking point. you probably
want to join the rt-users mailinglist.  Send a message to:

         rt-users-request@lists.fsck.com 

With the body of the message consisting of only the word:

        subscribe

If you're interested in hacking on rt, you'll want to subscribe to
rt-devel@lists.fsck.com.  Subscribe to it with instructions similar to
those above.

Address questions about the stable release to the rt-users list, and
questions about the development version to the rt-devel list.  If you feel
your questions are best not asked publically, send them personally to
jesse@fsck.com.

If you want to be informed of every commit to the CVS repository,
subscribe to rt-commit@fsck.com using similar instructions to those above.

RT WEBSITE
----------

For current information about RT, check out the RT website at 
http://www.fsck.com/projects/rt  You'll find screenshots, a pointer
to the current version of rt, contributed patches and lots of other great
stuff.


CREDITS
-------

A lot of people are responsible for making RT a better program.  Many
thanks to Lauren Burka, who originally tasked me with writing this beast.
She forced me to use a database backend.  I've thanked her for it every
day since.  Rich West rewrote this readme and did some UI hacking.  Adam
Hirsch, Kit Kraysha, Robin Garner, Jens Glaser, John Adams, Trey Belew, 
Sean Dague, Nathan Mehl, Kee Hinckley, Rich West, Dale Bewley, Serge Zhuk,
John Lengeling, Elmar Knipp, Gerald Abshez, Dave Hull, Dave Schenet,
Dave Walton, Jan Okrouhly, Tobias Brox, Lamont Lucas, Charlie Brady,
Robin Shostack, Eric Mumpower, Jerrod Weisman and Adam Hammer 
have all contributed bug reports, code or ideas that have helped RT along.  

Arepa, Inc, Utopia Inc, Wesleyan University and The Leftbank Operation 
have paid me to update RT and release it to the public.  Without their 
support RT would not exist.  

If I've left you out, please drop me a line ....it wasn't intentional. 
 

        Enjoy
