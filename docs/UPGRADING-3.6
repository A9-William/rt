UPGRADING FROM 3.6.X and earlier - Changes:

There are a lot of changes all over the code, so it's highly recommended to
use fresh directory and then reinstalling your customizations.

New schema for mysql 4.1 and greater, read more in UPGRADING.mysql.

Config format has been made stricter. All options MUST be set using Set
function, no more "@XXX = (...) unless @XXX;". Use "Set(@XXX, ...);" instead.

RTx::Shredder extension has been integrated into core and features have been
added, so you MUST uninstall it before upgrading or use a fresh directory for
installation.

New interface for making links in text clickable and doing other replacements
has been integrated into RT.
Read more in `perldoc docs/extending_clickable_links.pod`.

New feature that allow users to forward messages. There is a new option in
the config ($ForwardFromUser), new rights and a template.

New global templates with "Error: " prefix in the name to make it possible
to configure error messages sent to users.

Read about GnuPG integration in `perldoc docs/gnupg_integration.pod`.

New scrip conditions 'On Close' and 'On Reopen'.

UPGRADING FROM 3.5.7 and earlier - Changes:

Scrips are now prepared and committed in order alphanumerically by description.
This means that you can prepend a number (00, 07, 15, 24) to the beginning of
each scrip's description, and they will run in that order.  Depending on your
database, the old ordering may have been by scrip id number -- if that is the
case, simply prepend the scrip id number to the beginning of its description.


UPGRADING FROM 3.5.1 and earlier - Changes:

The default for $RedistributeAutoGeneratedMessages has changed to
'privileged', to make out-of-the-box installations more resistant
to mail loops. If you rely on the old default of redistributing to
all watchers, you'll need to set it explicitly now.
