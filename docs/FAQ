   what should RT_MAIL_TAG be, and why?
          
          RT_MAIL_TAG should be a unique site/install identifier. Every
          piece of mail which that RT sends out, regardless of Queue or
          Area, will have that token put onto the subject line, i.e.
          "Subject: [circus #8799] Too Many Monkeys!" (in this case, the
          RT_MAIL_TAG is "circus."
          
   Sends OUT? What about receives? the makefile implies that it's needed
          on
          
          incoming mail, as well.
          
          every piece of mail that it's supposed to parse correctly and
          add to an existing ticket will need that token as well.
          
   Where? Anyplace, in the body of the request, or some other special
          place?
          
          On the subject line.
          
   If they are going to have 2 seperate queues, one for internal IT and
          one for servers accessed from outside sources, will everyone
          use the same MAIL_TAG?
          yes. the same tag and the same ordinal system across both
          queues. (i.e. req's 4, 5, and 6 are in queue Foo. The next
          person to open a req in queue Bar will get given number 7.)
