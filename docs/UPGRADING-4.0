UPGRADING FROM RT 3.8.x and RTFM 2.1 or greater

RT4 now includes an Articles functionality, merged from RTFM.
You should not install and enable the RT::FM plugin separately on RT 4.
If you have existing data in RTFM, you can use the etc/upgrade/upgrade-articles
script to upgrade that data.

When running normal upgrade scripts, RT will warn if it finds existing
RTFM tables that contain data and point you to the upgrade-aricles script.

This script should be run from your RT tarball.  It will immediately
begin populating your new RT4 tables with data from RTFM.  If you have
browsed in the RT4 UI and created new classes and articles, this script
will fail spectacularly.  Do *not* run this except on a fresh upgrade of
RT.

You can run this as

  etc/upgrade/upgrade-articles

It will ouput a lot of data about what it is changing.  You should
review this for errors.

If you are running RTFM 2.0 with a release of RT, there isn't currently an upgrade
script that can port RTFM's internal CustomField and Transaction data to RT4.

*******
The deprecated classes RT::Action::Generic, RT::Condition::Generic and RT::Search::Generic
have been removed, but you shouldn't have been using them anyway. You should have been using
RT::Action, RT::Condition and RT::Search, respectively.

* The "Rights Delegation" and "Personal Groups" features have been removed.

* Replace the following code in templates:

    [{$Ticket->QueueObj->SubjectTag || $rtname} #{$Ticket->id}]

with

    { $Ticket->SubjectTag }

* Unique names are now enforced for user defined groups.  New groups cannot be
  created with a duplicate name and existing groups cannot be renamed to an
  in-use name.  The admin interface will warn about existing groups with
  duplicate names.  Although the groups will still function, some parts of the
  interface (rights management, subgroup membership) may not work as expected
  with duplicate names.  Running

    /opt/rt4/sbin/rt-validator --check

  will report duplicate group names, and running it with --resolve will fix
  duplicates by appending the group id to the name.

  Nota Bene: As a result of differing indexes in the schema files, Postgres and
  SQLite RT databases have enforced group name uniqueness for many years at the
  database level.
