Seems like most of the documentation here is for RT 1.0, eventually all the
documentation will be fixed by the RT Documentation Team (rt-docs@fsck.com)
which is led by Meri.

Documentation for RT 1.0 is being maintained by Michael Brader
<mbrader@stoic.com.au> and is based on earlier work by Adam Hirsch
<adam@baz.org>.
