For 2.0, those Linking actions should be supported:

1. Dependency link, TobiX-style.

 BASE is dependent on TARGET.

 ...when the link is set up, BASE will become stalled if it's open.
 ...when the TARGET is resolved, BASE will be reopened if it's stalled.
 
 The system should allow dependency links to point into Bugzilla.
 
2. MemberOf link (grouping)

 BASE is a member of TARGET.

 ...when TARGET is beeing replied to, all BASE requestors should get the
 reply.
 ...when TARGET is resolved, all BASE tickets should be resolved.
 
3. Merge link (connecting)

 BASE is the same as TARGET.

 ...the system should somehow merge together transactions for both tickets.
 ...BASE should be more or less deleted, only the TARGET should apply.
 ...actions done toward BASE should be redirected to TARGET.

For 2.1, it should be very easy to set up site-specific link action types.
