External Requestor

  Might be a customer or a potential customer.  We want to treat him as nice
  as possible.  (S)he shouldn't need to see too much of RT, the requestor
  should more feel like getting personal handling from a 1st line support
  department.  The external requestor might get access to the Web UI, but
  only to track his own requests.


Internal Requestor / regular Watcher

  An Internal Requestor might be 1st line support sending matters to tech
  support or similar. Might be an internal employee sending matters to tech
  support (or even 1st line support if he's not sure where to send matters).
  Might be just any user of an open source project sending in reports and
  support requests.  We consider Internal Requestors and Regular Watchers as
  more robust and capable human beeings than the fragile customers.  We
  don't mind letting them get entagled with RT, and we let them access the
  Web UI.  We don't mind letting them be Cc or Bcc instead of the To
  addressee at an email.  

  The system doesn't make any difference between requestors, but the RT
  users might pay some attention ... and the administrator should pay
  attention when setting up the templates.
