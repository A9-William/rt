What is an Action?

...some piece of code that can do something whenever a transaction is
done.  The actions shipped with RT sends email.  Eventually site-specific
modules can be dropped in to perform special actions.


What can an Action do?

- decide whether it's applicable or not
- prepare
- commit
- describe itself

...and if it's a subclass of SendEmail, you can also override:

- SetReceipients


What is a Scrip?

...it's an entry in the database that tells that an action is to be
performed with a certain template and argument.  It can be limited by
queue and transaction type.  It has a name and a description.

/* I want to move the queue to a new table, for easier queue admin. */


What is a Watcher?

...it's a request for beeing kept updated on a ticket and/or a queue
and/or whatever.  It is to be used by the Actions.  Watcher items can
easily be enabled/disabled through the `Quiet' attribute.  `Type' might
indicate what emails the watcher wants to get and how to get them.

The Bcc/Cc watchers should be handled by the NotifyWatchers action which is
run regardless of the Scrips.


What is a Template?

...A template is a text template that is to be used for outgoing email -
or for different use for different actions.  One template can be used by
several Scrips.
