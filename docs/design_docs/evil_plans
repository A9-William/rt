For 2.2:

	Saveable user preferences.
	Saveable user searches.
	Ability to define search result format.

For the near future:

	Use case:
		Jesse wants to get notified of all tickets in queue 'RT Bugs'
		with a severity of 'critical' and also have a requestor whcih matches 'fsck.com'.  
		I'm not sure this is the best idea.


	Site admins define a number of subscriptions and can sign up individual
	users, groups or metagroups to get mail on that subscription.

	Basically, an admin would define "On Condition, notify as comment with
	template _template_"

	There would be a new table called "subscriptions"(?) that would have
	the structure:

		id
		ScripId
		PrincipalType  ENUM: User, Group, Owner, Requestors, AdminCcs, Ccs
		PrincipalId --  UserId or GroupId.  For Owner, Requestors, AdminCcs, Ccs, it doesn't really make a lick of difference.
