Group ACLs
        
        the rights:


        CreatePersonalGroup
        CreateGroup

        AdminGroup
                * Update group metadata and access control list
        AdminGroupMembers
                * Add ad delete members of this group
        ModifyOwnMembership
                * Join and quit this group


        the primitives:
       
In user.pm

=item HasRight  { Right => 'somerightname', ObjectType => 'Group', ObjectId => 'GroupId'

        Returns true if this user has the right 'somerightname' for
the group with id 'Id'

=cut


=item RightsForObject { ObjectType => 'Group', ObjectId =>'GroupId' }

in users.pm

=item WhoHaveRight { Right =>'somerightname', ObjectType => 'Group', ObjectId => 'GroupId' }


        Finds all users who have the right 'somerightname' for the group
in question.

        If a user has "AdminGroupMembers" globally and we ask about 
        group 23, that user should be found.

=cut

Users must be able to delegate individual rights 

        * Is it that users can delegate any and all rights but it's
        only rights they _have_ which actually grant rights.

rights must not be redelegated

users must be able to create groups to which rights can be delegated.

Only users who have the "delegate rights" right can delegate rights.


When a user's right to do something is revoked, the delegation must 
be revoked

        * For any delegated ACL check, the delegator's right must be 
          checked immediately after the delegatee's right.
          If a user has had a right delegated by multiple parties, 
          this may mean that we need to actually loop through and check
          a bunch of possible delegations. Or can we craft a "has delegated 
          right" ACL check.
