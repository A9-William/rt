UPGRADING FROM 3.8.8 and earlier - Changes:

Previous versions of RT used a password hashing scheme which was too
easy to reverse, which could allow attackers with read access to the
RT database to possibly compromise users' passwords.  Even if RT does
no password authentication itself, it may still store these weak
password hashes -- using ExternalAuth does not guarantee that you are
not vulnerable!  To upgrade stored passwords to a stronger hash, run:

    perl etc/upgrade/vulnerable-passwords


We've proved that it's possible to delete set of records
from Transactions table without losing functionality. To delete
records run the following script:

    perl -I /opt/rt4/local/lib -I /opt/rt4/lib etc/upgrade/shrink_transactions_table.pl

If you chose not to run the shrink_cgm_table.pl script when you upgraded to 3.8,
you should read more about it below and run it at this point.

The default for $MessageBoxWrap is now SOFT and $MessageBoxWidth is now unset
by default.  This means the message box will expand to fill all the available
width.  $MessageBoxWrap is also overridable by the user now.  These changes
accommodate the new default two column layout for ticket create and update
pages.  You may turn this layout off by setting $UseSideBySideLayout to 0.  To
retain the original behavior, set $MessageBoxWrap to HARD and $MessageBoxWidth
to 72.

UPGRADING FROM 3.8.7 and earlier - Changes:

RT's ChartFont option has been changed from a string to a hash which
lets you specify per-language fonts. RT now comes with a better default
font for charts, too.

You should either update your 'ChartFont' option to match the new format
or consider trying the new default

RT now gives you more precise control over the order in which custom fields
are displayed.  This change requires some small changes to your currently saved
custom field orders.

RT will automatically clean up your existing custom fields when you run:


  /opt/rt4/sbin/rt-setup-database --dba root --prompt-for-dba-password --action upgrade

After that cleanup, you should make sure that custom fields are ordered in
a way that you and your users find pleasing.

UPGRADING FROM 3.8.6 and earlier - Changes:

For MySQL and Oracle users:
If you upgraded from a version of RT earlier than 3.7.81 you should
already have a CachedGroupMembers3 index on your CachedGroupMembers table.
If you did a clean install of RT somewhere in the 3.8 release series, you 
most likely don't have this index.  You can add it manually with

  CREATE INDEX CachedGroupMembers3 on CachedGroupMembers (MemberId, ImmediateParentId);

UPGRADING FROM 3.8.5 and earlier - Changes:

You can now forward an entire Ticket history (in addition to specific transactions)
but this requires a new Template called forward ticket.  This template will be added
when you run.

/opt/rt4/sbin/rt-setup-database --dba root --prompt-for-dba-password --action upgrade

Custom fields with categories can optionally be split out into
hierarchical custom fields.  If you wish to convert your old
category-based custom fields, run:

    perl etc/upgrade/split-out-cf-categories

It will prompt you for each custom field with categories that it
finds, and the name of the custom field to create to store the
categories.

If you were using the LocalizedDateTime RT::Date formatter from code
and passing a DateFormat or TimeFormat argument, you need to switch from 
the strftime methods to the cldr methods (ie full_date_format becomes date_format_full)
You may have done this from your RT_SiteConfig.pm by using
Set($DateTimeFormat, { Format => 'LocalizedDateTime', DateFormat => 'medium_date_format' );

UPGRADING FROM 3.8.3 and earlier - Changes:

Arguments to the NotifyGroup Scrip Action need
to be corrected in the database using 

/opt/rt4/sbin/rt-setup-database --dba root --prompt-for-dba-password --action upgrade


UPGRADING FROM 3.8.2 and earlier - Changes:

New scrip condition 'On Reject'.

UPGRADING FROM 3.8.1 and earlier - Changes:

= Oracle configuration =

$DatabaseName is used as SID, so RT can connect without environment variables
or tnsnames.ora file. Because of this change your RT instance may loose ability
to connect to your DB, you have to update options and restart your web server.
Example configuration:

    Set($DatabaseType, 'Oracle');
    Set($DatabaseHost, '192.168.0.1');
    # undefined port => will try both 1526 and 1521
    Set($DatabasePort, undef);
    # ORACLE SID
    Set($DatabaseName, 'XE');
    # user for RT in Oracle, RT's tables in his schema
    Set($DatabaseUser, 'test');
    # above user's password
    Set($DatabasePassword, 'test');

= Rights changes =

Now, if you want any user to be able to access the Approvals tools (a.k.a.  the
Approvals tab), you must grant that user the "ShowApprovalsTab" right.

UPGRADING FROM 3.8.0 and earlier - Changes:

Searches for bookmarked tickets have been reimplemented and syntax has
been changed a little. Database upgrade script handles global 'Bookmarked Tickets'
search only. New Ticket SQL "id = '__Bookmarked__'" is more flexible than
old "__Bookmarks__". Old version is not valid Ticket SQL query, so people
can not use it in the query builder and as well admins couldn't not edit
format and other properties of the global saved search. Old version's been
left for backwards compatibility.

UPGRADING FROM 3.7.85 and earlier - Changes:

We've proved that it's possible to delete pretty big set of records
from CachedGroupMembers table without losing functionality. To delete
record run the following script.  If you don't run this, you may
occasionally see problems where RT miscounts users, particularly in the
chart functionality.

    perl -I /opt/rt4/local/lib -I /opt/rt4/lib etc/upgrade/shrink_cgm_table.pl

After you run this, you'll have significantly reduced the number of
records in your CachedGroupMembers table and may need to tell your
database to refresh indexes/statistics.  Please consult your DBA for
specific instructions for your database.

UPGRADING FROM 3.7.81 and earlier - Changes:

RT::Extension::BrandedQueues has been integrated into core, and the
handling of subject tags has changed as a consequence.  You will need to
modify any of your email templates which use the $rtname variable, in
order to make them respect the per-queue subject tags. To edit your
templates, log into RT as your administrative user, then click:

    Configuration -> Global -> Templates -> Select -> <Some template name>

The only template which ships with RT which needs updating is the
"Autoreply" template, which includes this line:

    "There is no need to reply to this message right now.  Your ticket
    has been assigned an ID of [{$rtname} #{$Ticket->id()}]."

Change this line to read:

    "There is no need to reply to this message right now.  Your ticket
    has been assigned an ID of { $Ticket->SubjectTag }."

If you were previously using RT::Extension::BrandedQueues, you MUST
uninstall it before upgrading. In addition, you must run the
'etc/upgrade/3.8-branded-queues-extension' perl script.  This will
convert the extension's configuration into the new format.  Finally, in
templates where you were using the Tag method ($Ticket->QueueObj->Tag),
you will need to replace it with $Ticket->SubjectTag

RT::Action::LinearEscalate extension has been integrated into core,
so you MUST uninstall it before upgrading.

RT::Extension::iCal has been integrated into core, so you MUST uninstall
it before upgrading. In addition, you must run etc/upgrade/3.8-ical-extension
script to convert old data.

UPGRADING FROM 3.7.80 and earlier - Changes:

Added indexes to CachedGroupMembers for MySQL and Oracle.
If you have previously installed RTx-Shredder, you may already
have these indexes.  You can see the indexes by looking at
etc/upgrade/3.7.81/schema.*

These indexes may take a very long time to create.
