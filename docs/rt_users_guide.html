    <h1>RT:Request Tracker</h1>
  <p>This documentation describes what RT is and how to use it</p>


    <h1>How to use this document</h1>

    <p>This page is organised into two parts. <a
    href="#Section1">First</a>, there is a general section which
    explains RT as a system without providing any details of the local
    setup. The <a href="#Section2">second section</a> deals with any
    local customisations or configurations that may be of interest to
    local users.

    <p>I've tried to define any new words as I come across
    them. Further uses of the word should be linked back to the
    original definition. A definition looks like this:

    <p><a name="DEFNdefn">
    <table width="80%" border>
      <tbody>
	<tr>
	  <td class="defn-term"><span class="defn">Term</span></td>

	  <td class="defn-definition">Definition of term</td>
	</tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <a name="Section1"><h1>What is RT?</h1>

    <p>Request Tracker tracks requests. Requests are entered into
    queues either by sending email to a special address or by using
    the web interface. 

    <p>Alternatively, you could say that RT is a mechanism for
    managing and archiving email threads with a web interface. 

    <p>RT is both of these. The former describes its use and the
    latter describes its implementation. There are other interfaces,
    via email and CLI, but this document focuses on the web interface

    <p><a name="DEFNqueue">
    <table width="80%" border>
      <tbody>
	<tr>
	  <td class="defn-term"><span class="defn">Queue</span></td>

	  <td class="defn-definition">A queue is a way of grouping
	  requests. A queue has the following attributes:

	    <ul>

	      <li>A list of members who are authorised to manipulate
	      requests in this queue.</li>

	      <li>One or more members who are designated
	      administrators and can configure queue options</li>

	      <li>A mail alias to which new requests or feedback on
	      existing requests can be sent.</li>

	      <li>Possibly a list of areas which divide the queue into
	      smaller units</li>

	      <li>A set of configurable options accessible via the web
	      admin interface with respect to setting up who gets
	      mailed about what and who can raise requests in this
	      queue.</li>

	      <li>A set of mail template files which can be configured
	      to tailor messages sent by RT</li>

	    </ul>
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>When a request is received, it is assigned a unique identifier,
    a combination of a Site Identifier and a number. For example,
    <span class="output">[RequestTracker&nbsp;#127]</span>. Usually,
    the requestor is notified when a request is submitted.

    <p><a name="DEFNrequestor">
    <table width="80%" border>
      <tbody>
	<tr>
	  <td class="defn-term"><span class="defn">Requestor</span></td>

	  <td class="defn-definition">In RT, the Requestor is the person who
	  raised the request. A requestor is usually represented as an
	  email address. This is because the email address of the
	  sender of a message to an RT queue alias is used to fill in
	  the requestor field. When a request is raised using the web
	  interface, the address is obtained from the 'email' field of
	  the web user configuration.
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Any change to a request is stored as a transaction.

    <p><a name="DEFNtransaction">
    <table width="80%" border>
      <tbody>
	<tr>
	  <td class="defn-term"><span class="defn">Transaction</span></td>

	  <td class="defn-definition">A transaction is a stored change
	  to a request. It may be a comment or a reply, or it may be a
	  field change in the request headers or a state change. Each
	  transaction is stored and the transaction history of a
	  request may be viewed.
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>The other standard fields in a request are:

    <p><a name="DEFNfields">

	  <td class="defn-definition">Some <a

      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>In addition to the <a href="#DEFNrequestor">requestor</a>, the
    <a href="#DEFNqueue-members">queue members</a> are usually also
    notified via email.

    <p><a name="DEFNqueue-members">
    <table width="80%" border>
      <tbody>
	<tr>
	  <td class="defn-term"><span class="defn">Queue members</span></td>

	  <td class="defn-definition">Queue members are those people
	  who have permission to manipulate requests in a <a
	  href="#DEFNqueue">queue</a></td>
	</tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>So, a request is submitted. The <a
    href="#DEFNrequestor">requestor</a> and the <a
    href="#DEFNqueue-members">queue members</a> get mail, apparently
    from the queue mail alias containing the request. If anybody
    replies to the message, leaving the <a
    href="#DEFNfields-subject">subject</a> intact, the reply will be
    filed in RT as a comment on the request, and mailed out to the <a
    href="#DEFNqueue-members">queue members</a>, and so on and so
    on. Changes to <a href="#DEFNfields-status">status</a> or other
    fields can be made via the web interface.

    <p>RT uses the subject line of a message to decide what to do with
    it. If the subject contains the identifier of a request that
    already exists, the message becomes a comment. If the subject line
    contains no identifier, a new request will be
    created. <strong>Thus you should be careful with the subject
    header when sending messages to the RT alias to avoid creating new
    requests where they are not needed.</strong>

    <p>So, once a request is created, what next? You will notice a
    couple of things about mail sent by RT. First of all, the From
    address is the mail alias for that queue (though the Real name
    field is likely to be set to the <a
    href="#DEFNrequestor">requestor</a>). Thus, if you reply to the
    message, it is sent back to RT where the reply will be appended to
    the request and sent to the <a href="#DEFNqueue-members">queue
    members</a> and the <a href="#DEFNrequestor">requestor</a>. You
    can also reply to or comment on a request using the web interface.

    <p>Secondly, the subject looks like this:

    <p><span class="output">Subject: [RequestTracker #187] (at-review)
    Clean up code</span>

    <p>The format of this line is:

    <p><span class="output">Subject: [&lt;Site ID&gt; #&lt;request
    number&gt;] (&lt;queue name&gt;) &lt;subject&gt;</span>

    <p>If you reply to an RT message without changing the <a
    href="#DEFNfields-subject">subject</a>, RT knows which request
    you are referring too. If you change the subject, RT won't know
    and will assume that you intend to create a new request. Of
    course, a preceding <span class="output">Re: </span> is ignored.

    <a name="acl"><p>There are four levels of access to any particular
    queue:

    <p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No access</strong> - self-explanatory</li>

      <li><strong>Display</strong> - the user can view requests, but
      cannot modify them.</li>

      <li><strong>Manipulate</strong> - the user can modify requests,
      that is, change the values of fields or add comments and replies.</li>

      <li><strong>Admin</strong> - like manipulate, but the user can
      also access the admin interface to change queue properties or
      add/remove users.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>What can I do with a request?</h2>

    <p>There are many things that you can do with a request, the most
    common are commenting and replying. These actions have specific
    meanings in RT.

    <p><a name="DEFNcomment"><a name="DEFNreply">
    <table width="80%" border>
      <tbody>
	<tr>
	  <td class="defn-term"><span class="defn">Comment</span></td>

	  <td class="defn-definition">For a given Queue, anyone with
	  Manipulate privileges or higher may Comment on a Request.
	  Commenting is the most common way to update a Request.  It
	  adds a <A href="#DEFNtransaction">Transaction</A> and may or
	  may not (depending on how the Queue is configured)
	  automatically send mail to the <A
	  href="#DEFNrequestor">Requestor</A> or the <a
	  href="#DEFNqueue-members">queue members</a>.  It is intended
	  to be used for "internal" correspondence that is not sent to
	  the user.  Comments would only be sent to the <a
	  href="#DEFNrequestor">requestor</a> at installations which
	  have enabled "Notify User on Action" which is not
	  recommended, because of the sheer volume of mail
	  involved.</td>
	</tr>
        <tr>
	  <td class="defn-term"><span class="defn">Reply</span></td>

	  <td class="defn-definition">Replying to a Request does much
	  the same thing as Commenting on it does, but it also
	  explicitly sends email to the <A
	  href="#DEFNrequestor">Requestor</A>, regardless of how the
	  Queue is configured. RT will note the time of this
	  communication in the <a href="#DEFNfields-date_told">Last
	  User Contact</a> field.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>The most common way to comment or reply to a message is to use
    email. To comment, simply reply to an RT message or create a new
    message with the following string in the subject:

    <p><span class="output">[RequestTracker&nbsp;#&lt;request
    id&gt;]</span>

    <p>To reply, simply reply to the message and Cc: the <a
    href="#DEFNrequestor">requestor</a>

    <h2>The Web interface: Changing a request</h2>

    <p>While email is the easiest way to <a
    href="#DEFNcomment">comment</a> on or <a
    href="#DEFNreply">reply</a> to a request, most other changes are
    easiest in the web interface.

    <a name="login"><h3>Logging In</h3>

    <p>To log in, you need to (using your browser) go to the <a
    href="#RTurl">local RT URL</a>. You will be presented with the
    login screen if:

    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>you have not used RT before</li>
      <li>you have previously logged out</li>
      <li>You are using RT from a machine you have not used RT from
      before</li>
    </ul>

    <p>otherwise you will be presented with the display queue. You
    need to enter your username and password (your RT password, <b>not
    your account password</b>) at the relevant prompts. If you are
    returned to those prompts, then something went wrong, otherwise
    you should get to the display queue. Note: you must have cookies
    turned on to log in.

    <a name="query"><h3>The display queue and querying</h3>

    <p>When you first log in, you are presented with a list of all
    unresolved requests. If you can't easily find the request you
    want, scroll to the bottom of the RT page where you will find some
    selection boxes and a button marked "Update Queue filters". You
    can use these to query the database to narrow your search.

    <p>This is what you'll see if you successfully log in or you click
    the 'Display Queue' link in RT. A table is presented with various
    request fields and is filled in with all open bugs in queues where
    you have display access or better. Some notes about this page:

    <p>
    <ul>

      <li>The entries in the <a href="#DEFNfields-serial_num">serial
      number</a> column (the column heading is 'Ser') are clickable
      links to Request Display Screens.</li>

      <li>The two arrow shaped icons in each column are sorting
      buttons. If you click on them the display will be sorted by that
      field in forward (up arrow) or reverse (down arrow) order.</li>

      <li>If the request is overdue (the date set in the <a
      href="#DEFNfields-date_due">Due Date field</a> has passed), then
      the entry in that column is displayed in red.</li>

      <li>There is a form at the base of the page for refining the
      search query. You can select particular queues and/or request
      states as well as specifying the <a
      href="#DEFNfields-owner">owner</a>s of the request.</li>

      <li><a name="fourbuttons">Finally there are four links/buttons
      at the very bottom of the page. They are:

	<p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Display Queue - redisplay the queue, forgetting any
	  filters which have been set.</li>

	  <li>Create Request in Queue - displays the request
	  submission form for the selected queue</li>

	  <li>Display request # - Allows the selection of individual
	  requests by <a href="#DEFNfields-serial_num">serial
	  number</a>.</li>

	  <li>Logout - exits RT</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <a name="fields"><h3>The request display and changing fields</h3>

    <p>When you click on a request id in the queue display you are
    presented with the request display. In the request display, the
    following are displayed:

    <ul>
      <li>The same <a href="#fourbuttons">four buttons</a> as at the
      bottom of the queue display.</li>

      <li>If you have permission, links to make changes to the request
      (<a href="#DEFNcomment">comment</a>, <a
      href="#DEFNreply">reply</a>, take, etc.)</li>

      <li>The request headers</li>

      <li>The <a href="#DEFNtransaction">transaction</a> history of
      the request</li>

      <li>If you have permission, links to make changes to the request
      (<a href="#DEFNcomment">comment</a>, <a
      href="#DEFNreply">reply</a>, take, etc.)</li>

      <li>The same buttons as at the bottom of the queue display/</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To change a request field, simply click on one of the links at
    the top and bottom of the page or click on the fieldname in the
    request display. The following table shows the result of these
    actions.

    <p>

            <p>Example: While standing at the buffet, Charlie notices
            he's standing elbow to elbow with Biff, who sent in a
            Request that morning.  Charlie tells Biff that he may wish
            to untoggle his caps lock key if he wants man pages to
            work for him.  Biff walks away pleased, and after lunch,
            Charlie notes the interaction in the Request, including
            the fact that the <A href="#DEFNrequestor">Requestor</A>
            was notified.  Charlie's boss notices the fast turnaround

    <a name="add"><h3>Creating a new request</h3>

    <p>To add a request, <a href="#login">log in</a> if you haven't
    already, then look for the button marked "Create request in
    queue". Once you have found it, select the queue that you would
    like to add a request to and hit the button (the default queue is
    the sam queue for system administration requests).

    <p>Fill in the form, making sure that you use an informative <a
    href="#DEFNfields-subject">subject</a> line and include all
    relevant information. Fields you should always check are:

    <p><b>Area - </b>Some queues are divided into areas or subqueues

    <p><b>Priority - </b>Each queue can define its own <a
    href="#DEFNfields-priority">priority</a> scheme

    <p><b>Owner - </b>This is the person currently assigned to deal
    with this request

    <p><b>Date Due - </b>When this request should be resolved.

    <p><b>Requestor - </b>This should be your email address.

    <a name="update"><h3>Updating an existing request</h3>

    <p>To update a request, either find it in the table and click on
    its Id number, or if you already know it's number, find the button
    "Display request #", type in the number of the request and hit the
    button.

    <a name="exit"><h3>Exit</h3>

    <p>Clicking on this button will log you out of RT and place you
    back at the Login screen.

    <a name="admin"><h3>Administration web interface</h3>

    <p>If you go to the <a href="#RTadminurl">admin URL</a>, you can
    change your password or personal details by clicking on the
    "Modify your user account" button. Enter any new information then
    press the "Update user" button. You may need to <a
    href="#login">log in</a> first. If you have admin privileges for a
    queue, you can change that queue's parameters as well. If you have
    admin_rt privilege, you can change personal details for any
    user. You will only be shown those functions which you have
    permission to perform.

    <a name="ModifyYourAccount"><h3>Modify Your RT Account</h3>

    <p>Hitting this button takes you to a form where you can enter the
    following details:

    <ul>
      <li>Real Name - this will appear in any mail sent by RT as a
      result of your actions</li>

      <li>email - this should be your email address. It should be
      fully qualified (ie. <span class="output">jesse@fsck.com</span>
      rather than <span class="output">jesse</span>)</li>

      <li>password - it won't be displayed. To change it, enter the
      new password in the text box provided.</li>

      <li>phone/office/misc - these are essentially comment fields</li>

    </ul>

    <p>When you have set the fields you require, click on the "Update
    User" button at the bottom of the page.

    <a name="ModifyUser"><h3>Modify the user called</h3>

    <p>This is the same as <a href="#ModifyYourAccount">modifying your
    own account</a> except that you can modify anybody's details.

    <a name="CreateUser"><h3>Create a User called</h3>

    <p>Again, this is the same as <a
    href="#ModifyYourAccount">modifying your own account</a> except
    that you must fill in a username as well.

    <a name="ModifyQueue"><h3>Modify the Queue called</h3>

    <p>Hitting this button takes you to a form where you can enter the
    following details:

    <ul>
      <li>mail alias - the address configured to receive RT mail for
      the queue.</li>

      <li>initial priority - the default priority given to new requests.</li>

      <li>final priority - the priority to set requests to when they
      become due</li>

      <li>checkboxes - these checkboxes allow you to customise queue
      behaviour.

      <ul>
          <li>Mail request owner on transaction - if this checkbox is
          checked, the owner of a request is sent mail on every
          transaction</li>

          <li>Mail request queue members on transaction - similarly,
          if checked, all queue members are emailed on a
          transaction.</li>

          <li>Mail requestors on transaction - the requestor is mailed
          on each transaction. This option is rarely checked.</li>

          <li>Autoreply to requestors on creation - when a requestor
          submits a request, they receive a form email indicating that
          their request has been received. </li>

          <li>Mail correspondence to queue members - queue
          correspondence, that is,

            <ul>
              <li>replies to rt generated email</li>

              <li>transactions entered by using the Reply links or
              buttons in the request display.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Mail comments to queue members - comments entered by
          using the comment link in the request display.</li>

          <li>Allow non-members to create requests - If this option is
          checked, users who are not <a
          href="#DEFNqueue-members">queue members</a> can create
          requests. This means that you can set up queues where people
          with display access can create requests but only queue
          members may change them.</li>

        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Delete the area named - select the area to delete</li>

      <li>Add an area called - add a new area to the queue. Note that
      only one area can be added at a time from this form.</li>

      <li>Access Control - This is a list of the users that RT knows
      about and their <a href="#acl">access status</a> for this
      queue. Each user has a menu of the four access options</li>

    </ul>

    <p>When you have finished setting the options you desire, hit the
    "Update Queue" button to set the options in the RT database. Use
    the "Delete Queue" button to delete a queue and the "Main Menu"
    button to cancel the operation.

    <a name="CreateQueue"><h3>Create a Queue called</h3>

    <p>This is the same as <a href="#ModifyQueue">Modify the Queue
    called</a> except that you need to specify the name of the new
    queue. In addition there is some necessary setup (mail aliases and
    template files) that can not at present be achieved using the web
    interface.

    <a name="Section2"><h1>Local customisations</h1>

    <h3>Important URLs</h3>

    <p>
    <ul>
      <li><a name="RTurl"><a
