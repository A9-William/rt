=head1 Setting up the web interface

As of RT 3.9, RT's web interface has been built on top of PSGI
(L<http://plackperl.org>) which lets you use RT with any PSGI-supported web
server (which includes Apache, nginx, lighttpd, etc).

Once you've set up the web interface, consider setting up automatic
logout for inactive sessions. For more information about how to do that,
run:

    perldoc /path/to/rt/sbin/rt-clean-sessions

=head2 Standalone

The standalone RT web server is backed by a pure-Perl server engine
(L<HTTP::Server::PSGI>). This standalone server is appropriate for development,
testing, and so on, but is not appropriate for production use.

You should not run this server against port 80 (which is the default port)
because that requires root-level privileges and may conflict with any existing
listeners. So choose a high port (for example 8080) and run the server:

    /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-server 8080

=head2 mod_perl

=head3 mod_perl 1.xx

WARNING: mod_perl 1.99_xx is not supported.

See below configuration instructions for mod_perl 2.x

To install RT with mod_perl 1.x, you'll need to install the
apache database connection cache. To make sure it's installed, run
the following command:

    perl -MCPAN -e'install "Apache::DBI"'

Next, add a few lines to your Apache 1.3.xx configuration file, so that
it knows where to find RT:

    <VirtualHost your.ip.address>
        ServerName your.rt.server.hostname

        DocumentRoot /opt/rt3/share/html
        AddDefaultCharset UTF-8

        # optional apache logs for RT
        # ErrorLog /opt/rt3/var/log/apache.error
        # TransferLog /opt/rt3/var/log/apache.access

        PerlModule Apache::DBI
        PerlRequire /opt/rt3/bin/webmux.pl

        <Location /NoAuth/images>
            SetHandler default
        </Location>
        <Location />
            SetHandler perl-script
            PerlHandler RT::Mason
        </Location>
    </VirtualHost>

=head3 mod_perl 2.xx

WARNING: mod_perl 1.99_xx is not supported.

Add a few lines to your Apache 2.xx configuration file, so that
it knows where to find RT:

    <VirtualHost your.ip.address>
        ServerName your.rt.server.hostname

        DocumentRoot /opt/rt3/share/html
        AddDefaultCharset UTF-8

        # optional apache logs for RT
        # ErrorLog /opt/rt3/var/log/apache2.error
        # TransferLog /opt/rt3/var/log/apache2.access

        PerlRequire "/opt/rt3/bin/webmux.pl"

        <Location /NoAuth/images>
            SetHandler default
        </Location>
        <Location />
            SetHandler perl-script
            PerlResponseHandler RT::Mason
        </Location>
    </VirtualHost>

=head2 FastCGI

Installation with FastCGI is a little bit more complex and is documented
in detail at L<http://wiki.bestpractical.com/index.cgi?FastCGIConfiguration>

In the most basic configuration, you can set up your webserver to run
as a user who is a member of the "rt" unix group so that the FastCGI script
can read RT's configuration file.  It's important to understand the security
implications of this configuration, which are discussed in the document
mentioned above.

To install RT with FastCGI, you'll need to add a few lines to your
Apache configuration file telling it about RT:

    # Tell FastCGI to put its temporary files somewhere sane.
    FastCgiIpcDir /tmp

    FastCgiServer /opt/rt3/bin/mason_handler.fcgi -idle-timeout 120

    <VirtualHost rt.example.com>
       ServerName your.rt.server.hostname

       # Pass through requests to display images
       Alias /NoAuth/images/ /opt/rt3/share/html/NoAuth/images/

       AddHandler fastcgi-script fcgi
       ScriptAlias / /opt/rt3/bin/mason_handler.fcgi/
    </VirtualHost>
