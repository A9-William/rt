<h3>Administrative Duties</h3>

<dl>
<dt><strong> What can I do as an RT administrator?</strong>
<p>
<dd> You can add, delete, or modify users, queues, areas, and access levels.

<p>

<dt><strong>What can I change about a User?</strong>
<p>

<dd>     If you are an &RT& Admin, you are allowed to directly change other
     Users' setups.  If you are not, you're only allowed to change your own.
     <p>

     Usernames are unchangeable.  If you've got to change it, you'll need
     to create a new user with the new name and give them the same
     permissions as you.

<p>
     You may change the email address associated with a User, their
     password, phone number, office designation, and "misc" field which can
     contain any information you'd like (full name, astrological sign, food
     allergies, etc.).

<p>
     You may also give them "RT Admin" privileges, which will let them do
     everything you can.

<p>

<dt><strong> What can I change about a Queue?</strong>
<p>

<dd>    the Mail Alias for a Queue, which is used in putting return addresses on
    mail sent out regarding a particular queue.  
<p>
    the default Initial Priority for any Request started in the Queue.
<p>
    the defaul Final Priority for such Requests.
<p>
    Whether or not the Request Owner receives copies of every transactions
    associated with that Request.
<p>

  <blockquote> 
  EX: Benny has taken charge of a large and thorny problem.
  While she is the official Owner, she has delegated some of the research
  necessary to solve the problem to other people.  As they report their
  findings into the Request, Benny would like to see them.  She checks the
  box marked "Mail request owner on transaction."
  </blockquote>

    Whether or not Queue Members receive copies of every transaction that
    happens in the Queue.
<p>

<blockquote>	
EX: Kee, Brian, and Moira all have Manipulate access to the
Queue "general," and all of them want to be kept appraised of what's going on
with other Requests therein, even those owned by one of the other two people.
</blockquote>

    Whether or not the Requestor will automatically receive any Transaction
    having to do with their Request.
<p>
    Whether or not &RT& will autoreply to someone who's just created a
    Request, acknoledging their Request and letting them know the Request
    Number. 
<p>
    Whether or not Queue Correspondence (that is, Transactions specifically
    sent to the Requestor as well as added to the Request) gets mailed to
    every Queue Member.
<p>
    Whether or not Queue Comments (that is, Transactions meant to be added
    to a Request and not explicitly sent to the Requestor) get mailed to
    every Queue Member.
<p>
    Whether or not non-Queue Members are allowed to create Requests.
    Remember, someone with Display access is not considered a Queue Member.
<p>

<blockquote>
EX: Marc wants all of his users to be able to mail in
Requests, but doesn't want to give them all Manipulate access to the Queue.
By checking the "Allow Non-Queue Members to create Requests" checkbox, he
allows them to create Requests, but leaves them all with only Display
privileges in the Queue, so that they can look at the Requests without being
able to screw them up.  
</blockquote>	

    Area Control -- If you have Administrative access to the Queue, you may
    delete or create Areas within it.
<p>   
    Access Control -- If you have Administrative access to the Queue, you
    may change other users' access levels within that Queue.
