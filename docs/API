RT API

Some RT classes should never be instantiated by client code.
If you find yourself needing to do so, either you're doing something wrong or
we are. Write to rt-devel. We'll get to the bottom of it.

RT::Transactions,
RT::Transaction:  You should never be creating new transactions in your own
code. Ever.

RT::Watchers,
RT::Watcher:  You should be using the watchers API in RT::Ticket

RT::Links,
RT::Link: you should be using the Link api in Ticket.pm

RT::Attachments,
RT::Attachment: You should never be attaching things outside of a transaction.
You should always just be passing a MIME::Entity to Ticket::Comment or Ticket::Correspond
