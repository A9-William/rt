<dl>

<dt><strong>what should RT_MAIL_TAG be, and why?</strong>
<p>

<dd>   RT_MAIL_TAG should be a unique site/install identifier.
   Every piece of mail which that RT sends out, regardless of Queue or Area,
   will have that token put onto the subject line, i.e.
     "Subject: [circus #8799] Too Many Monkeys!" 
     (in this case, the RT_MAIL_TAG is "circus."

<dt><strong>Sends OUT? What about receives?  the makefile implies that it's needed on</strong>
<p>
incoming mail, as well.

<dd>   every piece of mail that it's supposed to parse correctly and add to
   an existing ticket will need that token as well.

<dt><strong>Where? Anyplace, in the body of the request, or some other special place?</strong>
<p>

<dd>   On the subject line.         

<dt><strong>If they are going to have 2 seperate queues, one for internal IT and one for servers accessed from outside sources, will everyone use the same MAIL_TAG?</strong>

<dd>   yes.  the same tag and the same ordinal system across both queues.  (i.e.
   req's 4, 5, and 6 are in queue Foo.  The next person to open a req in queue
   Bar will get given number 7.)
