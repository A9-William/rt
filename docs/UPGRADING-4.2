UPGRADING FROM RT 4.0.0 and greater

* The $LogToScreen config setting is now named $LogToSTDERR which better
  describes what the log level controls.  Setting $LogToScreen will still work,
  but an informational notice will be issued on server start telling you about
  the rename.  To avoid this you should set $LogToSTDERR instead.

* The link direction and type maps are consolidated into RT::Link.  If you
  wrote local customizations or extensions utilizing %RT::Ticket::LINKDIRMAP,
  %RT::Ticket::LINKTYPEMAP, RT::Ticket->LINKDIRMAP, RT::Ticket->LINKTYPEMAP, or
  %RT::Record::LINKDIRMAP, you will need to switch to %RT::Link::DIRMAP and
  %RT::Link::TYPEMAP.
