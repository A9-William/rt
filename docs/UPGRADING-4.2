UPGRADING FROM RT 4.0.0 and greater

* The $LogToScreen config setting is now named $LogToSTDERR which better
  describes what the log level controls.  Setting $LogToScreen will still work,
  but an informational notice will be issued on server start telling you about
  the rename.  To avoid this you should set $LogToSTDERR instead.

* The link direction and type maps are consolidated into RT::Link.  If you
  wrote local customizations or extensions utilizing %RT::Ticket::LINKDIRMAP,
  %RT::Ticket::LINKTYPEMAP, RT::Ticket->LINKDIRMAP, RT::Ticket->LINKTYPEMAP, or
  %RT::Record::LINKDIRMAP, you will need to switch to %RT::Link::DIRMAP and
  %RT::Link::TYPEMAP.

* $LinkTransactionsRun1Scrip is removed.  If you were relying on this behaviour
  (by setting it to 1), you should adjust your scrips to ignore one of the link
  transactions.

* The $AttachmentUnits option was removed in preference of always displaying in
  megabytes, kilobytes, or bytes as appropriate.  The option was incompletely
  implemented and controlled display in the attachments list but not history.

* MakeClicky handlers added via a callback are now passed an "object" key in
  the parameter hash instead of "ticket".  The object may be any RT::Record
  subclass.

* $MessageBoxWrap was removed.  Wrapping is now always SOFT.  If you want hard
  line breaks, enter them manually.
