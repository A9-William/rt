UPGRADING FROM RT 4.0.0 and greater

* The $LogToScreen config setting is now named $LogToSTDERR which better
  describes what the log level controls.  Setting $LogToScreen will still work,
  but an informational notice will be issued on server start telling you about
  the rename.  To avoid this you should set $LogToSTDERR instead.

* Rich text (HTML) messages are now preferred for display.  If you prefer plain
  text messages, set $PreferRichText to 0.

* User email addresses are now validated by default and multiple,
  comma-separated addresses for a single user are no longer allowed.  Existing
  users with invalid addresses will continue to work until the next time they
  are updated by an administrator on the modify user page.  If you prefer no
  address validation, set $ValidateUserEmailAddresses to 0.
