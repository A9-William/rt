UPGRADING FROM RT 4.0.0 and greater

* The $LogToScreen config setting is now named $LogToSTDERR which better
  describes what the log level controls.  Setting $LogToScreen will still work,
  but an informational notice will be issued on server start telling you about
  the rename.  To avoid this you should set $LogToSTDERR instead.

* The $AttachmentUnits option was removed in preference of always displaying in
  megabytes, kilobytes, or bytes as appropriate.  The option was incompletely
  implemented and controlled display in the attachments list but not history.
