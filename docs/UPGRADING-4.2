UPGRADING FROM RT 4.0.0 and greater

* The $LogToScreen config setting is now named $LogToSTDERR which better
  describes what the log level controls.  Setting $LogToScreen will still work,
  but an informational notice will be issued on server start telling you about
  the rename.  To avoid this you should set $LogToSTDERR instead.

* The $DeferTransactionLoading was combined into the new option $ShowHistory.
  If you had enabled $DeferTransactionLoading, you may want to set $ShowHistory
  to "click".  However, $ShowHistory provides a new mode, "defer", which is the
  default and may be a more appealing alternative to "click".
