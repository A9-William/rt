rtname is the string that RT will look for in mail messages to
figure out what ticket a new piece of mail belongs to

Your domain name is recommended, so as not to pollute the namespace.
once you start using a given tag, you should probably never change it.
(otherwise, mail for existing tickets won't get put in the right place
EOF
,
Organization => <<'EOF'
You should set this to your organization's DNS domain. For example,
fsck.com or asylum.arkham.ma.us. It's used by the linking interface to
guarantee that ticket URIs are unique and easy to construct.
EOF
,
TimeZone => <<'EOF'
$Timezone is used to convert times entered by users into GMT and back again
It should be set to a timezone recognized by your local unix box.
