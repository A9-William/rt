This file should contain a list of contributions.

No-ModPerl - things that might be usable for setting up a CGI/FCGI version
	     of RT.  This directory should eventually die, and all this
	     stuff should either be available through CPAN or the RT
	     release.  I just don't have time at the moment.  -- TobiX
	     
Bugzilla   - Bugzilla integration.  -- TobiX

KB         - Integration to Jesse's knowledge base.  -- TobiX

folding.el - An emacs plugin.  This is the reason why we have all those
             weird # {{{ comments

ApacheWrapper.pm - Replacement for the Apache object for CGI-users.

ApacheSessionFile.pm - I had problems with Apache::Session, and made this
             file.
