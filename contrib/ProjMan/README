I'm slowly starting to hack a Project Management system built at the
top of RT2.  Those hacks are actually beeing used locally, but they
are not (yet) wrapped or released for public usage.

There should eventually be a Makefile here.  Though, I don't have much
working experience with Makefiles, distributions and wrapping, so
somebody else will have to do that.  This works from my shell - it
might need adjustments:

	# Actually, I'm using /tmp for all experiments ;)
	my_rt_lib_dir=/tmp/FunRT/
	my_rt_web_dir=/tmp/rt/webrt/
	my_rt_db_name=RT11
	
	# The location of the distribution is used directly, so copy
        # or untar this wherever you'd like it to be.
	my_projman_dir=$PWD
	
	cd $my_rt_lib_dir
	ln -s $my_projman_dir/lib ./ProjMan
	cd $my_rt_web_dir
	ln -s $my_projman_dir/web ./ProjMan
	mysql $my_rt_db_name < $my_projman_dir/schema.mysql
