this file contains basic notes for what an RT testsuite should do.
at the moment we're talking about a system testsuite and not a
unit testsuite.  that should exist too.

this testsuite verifies that RT has been installed correctly and has a 
complete and functional database with (at least) some proper defaults.


things to check:

systemuser exists
nobody exists
root exists


systemuser and nobody are system users
root has acls


as root:

we can create a queue
we can create a privileged user 
we can grant that user the rights to create, see and modify tickets in that queue
we can create a nonpriviledged user
the non-prived user can't create a ticket in that queue
we can allow 'requestor' to create and see requests in that queue
the non-prived user can't create a ticket in that queue
