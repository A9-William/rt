This directory contain files required for the translation
of RTFM interfaces.

po/rtfm.pot is a template.

To start a new translation, copy the template to po/<lang>.po
where <lang> is your language, for example ru, pt, pt_BR
or other.

There are currently no translations to any language, so you 
may encounter some problems.

Some strings may be missing from the rtfm.pot file.
Two possible reasons:

1) Template is out of date. 

You can regenerate file using sbin/extract-message-catalog script
from RT 3.8.2 or newer tarball. If you're still on 3.8.1 you can
fetch this script from the repository:

    wget http://code.bestpractical.com/bps-public/rt/3.8/trunk/sbin/extract-message-catalog

Change directory to where you unpacked RTFM's sources and run:
    
    perl extract-message-catalog

This command will scan all files and update the files in the po
dir.

2) String is not in .po even after manual update using above
   command. 

This may happen if a developer forgot to use loc function or /l
mason component. Usually it's easy to fix. Find the string in the
source, wrap it into call to the function or the component. You can
find examples of using these all over the code. Then update message
catalogs using the directions above.
