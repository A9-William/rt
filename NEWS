	Well, Here's RT 0.9.17.  .9.15 and .9.16 were released over the past
	several days and have most of the improvements in this new version.
	
	New:
		* Documentation from <adam@apocalypse.org> (see rt/docs) 
		 it's still in preliminary form, but it's here
		* cleaned up admin interface
		* bug fixes for mysql 3.21 (though there are issues with 
		mysql 3.21 and the web interface that have been reported by SOME
		users.

		* Ingo Luetkebohle <ingo@devconsult.de> has contributed the 
		  beginnings of code to allow an http server to perform 
		  authentication for us. (Like apache-ssl with mod_mysql_auth)
		  expect this in the next beta or so

		* 3 and 5 minute refresh options in web-queue-view

		* auto-configuration of cern httpd.conf files.  apache version
		  coming soon.


		* Eliminated apparent need for glimpse.  We're never going to 
		  use it. Instead we'll just be going to mysql for transaction
		  content by 1.1 or so.

		A bunch of other stuff I've forgotten.

	RT 0.9.10 is a probably a bit more flaky than 0.9.9.  I added a bunch of
	new ui stuff and made the install more configurable and made upgrades
	easier.  Changes are too numerous to list but here's a summary:

	webrt:
	* nicer display of forms in netscape.
	* nicer display of forms in lynx
	* got rid of ugly black button bar
	* queue can now auto-refresh

	rt once again works w/ sendmail versions < 8.8 
	rt now works with mysql 3.21 (untested)
	the readme is more verbose
	the readme now tells you exactly how to make apache work with RT

	all in all we're much closer to 1.0.  I feel a lot better about the 
	web ui than I have in recent memory.  the cli could still use some work.

	RT 0.9.8 is a lot more robust than 0.9.7.  I've played with this version a lot more
	than other recent releases.  A lot of tiny little bugs that just made things hard have been
	eradicated.  This version doesn't change anything major.  However, a lot of the changes made in
	0.9.5, 0.9.6 and 0.9.7 now actually work.  There shouldn't be any more taint complaints.
	Also, the web UI now sports an additional button bar for the most frequently used buttons.
	A lot of the silly stuff i was doing with procedure calls to make html tables has been wiped.
	that should make things a bit speedier.  
	WebRT will now tell you who you're logged in as.
	make upgrade (for upgrades from .9.5 or greater) now works
	transaction reporting by mail is now more verbose
	mailgate will now drop mail loops from postmaster.
	and many other small bug fixes that have been nagging me for the past 6 months.
	

1 Jan 1998
----------
	Extensive changes have been made to rt's internals in preparation for a 1.0 release
	Mysql serial numbers are now used in place of the reqnum and transactnum c programs.
	RT's library structure has been extensively reworked to make it more readable and 
		maintainable. this may have degraded performance slightly. if RT is noticably 
		slower, I want to know about it.
	Replaced the C setuid wrapper with a more flexible & stable perl version.
	Moved RT.pm to the etc directory and restructured it to be more maintainable.
	Reworked the makefile to concentrate all install-time options in a single location.
		config.pm, mysql.acl and rtmux.pl will be automatically configured with the values
		set in the makefile
	Several typos fixed.
	Adding comments in webrt no longer opens a spurious window.
	Soon, CC and Bcc on response/comment will be possible.
	database interaction has been cleaned up.
	RT now runs with TAINT checks enabled. this is much safer, but may cause rt to yelp. if it
		does, please report it.


Aug 24, 1997
------------
	The mailing routines now correctly print the To: line.
	The mailing routines should now be able to handle bizzare 
	  email addresses on the command line. (I added a pair of " marks.)

25 Aug 1997
-----------
	Changing subject now returns a correct response.
	Database Select errors are now more verbose.
	Added in Rich West's new README. (Thanks, Rich!)

9 Sep 1997
----------
	Added support routines for importing requests
	Added rich west's req2rt program in contrib
	Web interface now does header parsing
	Web interface now displays things in <angle brackets> in messages properly.
	There were other fixes which I've forgotten.
