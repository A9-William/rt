1 Jan 1998
----------
	Extensive changes have been made to rt's internals in preparation for a 1.0 release
	Mysql serial numbers are now used in place of the reqnum and transactnum c programs.
	RT's library structure has been extensively reworked to make it more readable and 
		maintainable. this may have degraded performance slightly. if RT is noticably 
		slower, I want to know about it.
	Replaced the C setuid wrapper with a more flexible & stable perl version.
	Moved RT.pm to the etc directory and restructured it to be more maintainable.
	Reworked the makefile to concentrate all install-time options in a single location.
		config.pm, mysql.acl and rtmux.pl will be automatically configured with the values
		set in the makefile
	Several typos fixed.
	Adding comments in webrt no longer opens a spurious window.
	Soon, CC and Bcc on response/comment will be possible.
	database interaction has been cleaned up.
	RT now runs with TAINT checks enabled. this is much safer, but may cause rt to yelp. if it
		does, please report it.
