To take a look at current and future projects on RT2:

To look RT 2.0's open bugs:

http://www.fsck.com/rt/webrt.cgi?username=rt2guest&password=rt2guest&q_status=open&q_queue=RT+2.0+Bugs&display=Queue

The queues above will probably be more up-to-date and more complete than
this list, but anyway Tobix find it easier to deal with a flat textfile than
an RT1 queue at a remote box.  This is Tobix' list as of May 11 2000:

- probably a lot of work with the GUI, particularly handling links


- user information + user prioritying.

- "Smart" Next/Prev-links

This is a GUI detail, which probably will have to wait until post-2.0.
(from now on; post).

- Smart autoreplier

I have described the functionality earlier, and I think this is a good
thing.  might be contr, might be post.

- all other requested nifty features

post, probably :)
