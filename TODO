RT Todo List

. Allow CCs on Correspondence

. Glimpse Searching

. Reporting Scripts

. Change rt to rtm

. Move request display into rtq

. Allow sub-requests.

. Installation should use perl for access granting.
	Remove mysql.acl, etc.

	

. Web interface for requestors.
. Convert to DBI. (So one could use oracle, mysql, etc.)
. Simplify Web interface.
. "Actions since" command (cli, web)
. cleaner cli.
. mailgate should be better about mime.
. Searching on text of requests.



RT Wish List
. rt daemon. (for running interfaces remotely or not setuid)
	This is actually not terribly hard. almost all of the code needed
	can be found in the improved mail gateway.

. TK interface
