A rough sketch of what's coming for 2.2. to be fleshed out later.

likely it will be "saveable preferences, saveable searches, 
          easier upgrades, freeform custom fields, integrated cvs, enhanced 
                    mailgate, wapRT and templated responses. oh. and some
                    reporting.
