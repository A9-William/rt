To take a look at current and future projects on RT2:

To look RT 2.0's open bugs:

http://www.fsck.com/rt/webrt.cgi?username=rt2guest&password=rt2guest&q_status=open&q_queue=RT+2.0+Bugs&display=Queue

The queues above will probably be more up-to-date and more complete than
this list, but anyway Tobix find it easier to deal with a flat textfile than
an RT1 queue at a remote box.  This is Tobix' list as of May 11 2000:

- probably a lot of work with the GUI, particularly handling links

- date handling

- user information + user prioritying.

Locally, we often have users with different emails.  We need to keep track
of them, also when they change emails.  We need to store comments about
them.  Most important; we must be able to rate them!  Good customers
should get a higher priority than ordinary requestors, and those
should get a higher priority than those who constantly bother us with
stupid FAQs.

I'd daresay that this will not be included in the official RT 2.0 release,
but it will be available as a user contributed patch, and it will be
included in post-2.0 releases (from now on; contr).

- Admin tools & ACL.

We don't need it locally for some weeks, at least - I handle it through
SQL as for now.  Anyway, it must come before the official RT 2.0 release.  

- Groups

This is essensial for us if an admin tool should be useful. contr.

- "Smart" Next/Prev-links

This is a GUI detail, which probably will have to wait until post-2.0.
(from now on; post).

- Smart autoreplier

I have described the functionality earlier, and I think this is a good
thing.  might be contr, might be post.

- all other requested nifty features

post, probably :)
