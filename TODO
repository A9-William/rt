RT Todo List for 1.1

. Reporting Scripts in mainline distribution
. Move request display into rtq
. Allow sub-requests.
. Web interface for requestors.
. Test and get it working with other DBMS's
. "Actions since" command (cli, web)
. cleaner cli.
. mailgate should be better about mime.
. Searching on text of requests.


RT Wish List
. rt daemon. (for running interfaces remotely or not setuid)
	This is actually not terribly hard. almost all of the code needed
	can be found in the improved mail gateway.
